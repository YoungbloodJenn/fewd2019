        <h3>About Go Bag Builder</h3>

    <p class="about">Hi, I'm Jenn Youngblood and I'm excited to welcome you to Go Bag Builder! 
        Go Bag Builder is a project I created as part of General Assembly's Front End Web Development
        course in 2019. I have wanted to create a tool that helps 
        individuals prepare for emergencies and disasters for years. As a 
        former EMT and USN corpsman I have always had a passion for 
        emergency/disaster prep and my training has given me the skills and 
        knowledge to help others. 
        <br></br>
        I experienced my own disaster scenario in high school when my family 
        home was struck by lightening and burned down. It was an incident 
        that planted a deep need in me to always be ready for the unexpected. 
        Knowing people are prepared to "grab and go" gives me great
        satisfaction. In the new reality of extreme weather disasters we
        need to prepare individuals to respond to emergency now more than ever.
