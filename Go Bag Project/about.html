        <h2>About Go Bag Builder</h2>

    <p class="about">
        Hi and welcome you to Go Bag Builder! 
        <b>Go Bag Builder</b> is a project I created as part of General Assembly's Front End Web Development
        course in 2019. I wanted to create a tool that helps 
        individuals prepare for emergencies and disasters. As a 
        former EMT and US Navy Corpsman I have always had a passion for 
        emergency/disaster prep and my training has given me the skills and 
        knowledge to help others. 
        <br></br>
        My family lived through a house fire when I was I was in high school planted a deep need in me to always be ready for the unexpected. Living
        through 9/11 and then Hurricane Katrina & Rita further reinforced my desire to be <em>READY!</em>
        Knowing people are prepared to "grab and go" gives me great
        satisfaction. In the new reality of extreme weather disasters we
        need to prepare individuals to respond to emergency now more than ever.
